            <li>Heat half tbsp oil in a pan. Saute green chilies, cashews, and spinach for 3 to 4 mins until the leaves wilt off thoroughly & raw smell of  spinach has gone away.[ Or, another option is to blanch the palak in  4 cups of hot water with 1/4 tsp salt for 2 min. Then immerse in ice cold water. Drain completely.</li>
            <li>Cool this completely. Blend this along with 1/4 cup of water to a smooth puree. The puree should be smooth and thick. You may add 1 to 2 tbsp more water to help in blending.</li>
